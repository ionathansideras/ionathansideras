## About Me 🚀

I thrive on crafting delightful user experiences using technologies like React, TypeScript, JavaScript, CSS, SCSS, node.js and firebase. My toolkit also includes Vite for speedy development, and I'm adept at ensuring the reliability of my projects through Cypress & vitest testing.

I pursued my passion for technology early on, majoring in Computer Science at vocational high school. Despite not having a university degree, I've gained hands-on experience and continuously expanded my skills through practical projects and ongoing self-education.

## Learning Adventures 📚

I've embarked on a couple of significant learning experiences, completing courses at **The Odin Project**,  Harvard's **CS50x** and the **Modern React with Redux 2024 Update**. Currently, I'm deepening my knowledge through various Udemy courses, always eager to stay ahead in the dynamic world of web development.

## Professional Journey 💼

I work alongside a cool team of backend developers and designers, and I’m the front-end developer who loves tweaking and transforming our projects.
